Following along with Brian Holt's _Complete Intro to Web Development, v3_ course.

# Rules

- A new word is available each day.
- Try to guess today's word.
- Once you've entered five letters, press Enter to submit.
- If a letter's border turns **green**, it's correct and in the right position.
- If a letter's border turns **orange**, it's correct but in the wrong position.
- If a letter's background turns **gray**, it is not in today's word.
- If all letters have a **red** border, the word is invalid (i.e., it isn't a real word).

Have a good fun!

_This project is not yet complete, I still need to improve the style (make some fancy animation) and does not exactly end the game_
